worldwidejimmy: Hi Grok, We are on MacOS, can you make a react.js/vite app in this directory that we can navigate to with a local browser?

This web app should have advanced graphics and sound, and will be able to do many cool things, the top of the web page should have drop down for which cool thing, the first cool thing we will do is draw random fractal graphics that change based on mouse movement, the mouse movement seeds the fractal graphics, and it should play very relaxing music

The React/Vite app has been successfully created in your workspace directory. The development server is running, and I've opened it in the Simple Browser at http://localhost:5173.

The app features:
- A dropdown at the top to select "cool things"
- The first option: Interactive fractal graphics that regenerate based on mouse movement, with random colors and relaxing background music via Web Audio API

You can now interact with the app in the browser. If you'd like to add more "cool things" or enhancements, let me know!
